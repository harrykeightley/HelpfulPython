# Welcome!

Welcome to HelpfulPython; a free course designed to teach absolute beginners the
fundamentals of programming in Python. Read below to find out why you should take our course, or just [jump straight in!](/course)

## What will you learn in this course?

In this course you will learn:

1. How to effectively translate ideas into programs, and the building blocks for facilitating this.
2. How to do the above while prioritising readability and maintainability.

Broadly, the focus of this course is on teaching **important programming fundamentals** and
**good habits**, rather than just providing an overview of the syntax. We want you to be able to take the concepts you have learned in the course and quickly adapt to using a new language if need be. Having said that, as this course is designed for people who have never programmed before, the first few modules will introduce basic Python syntax, by necessity.

By the end of this course you should be able to solve or automate real-world tasks with programming. Futhermore, you will have a solid baseline from which to extend your knowledge independently, in order to solve increasingly-complex problems.

## Why us?

The authors of this course have a combined decade worth of experience in teaching university students how to program for the first time.
Through our teaching experience, we have gained some fairly unique insight into the areas which cause the most trouble for students, and we both wanted the chance to teach our favourite topics in the way we wish we were taught.

Both authors currently work in software (across industry, start ups, and academia), so we interact with code written by others on a daily basis. Due to this, we're invested in creating a new generation of programmers who create high-quality code that can be understood and extended easily by other programmers.

To learn more about the authors of this course, see the [About Us](/about) page.

## Why should you learn to code?

Perhaps you're preparing for university and want to get a head start? Maybe you're
wanting to automate that soul-sucking spreadsheet filling you've been
doing for work? Maybe you want to learn how to create video games? Maybe the pandemic
has inspired a career switch into a field where you can work from home
indefinitely with a high degree of job security? Or maybe you just want to give
your resume a boost, even if you don't want to work in software. Regardless of
your employment situation, learning to code is always a valuable skill to invest
in.

The most obvious reason to learn to code is if you want to get a job in
software.

- Programming, as a career, is **lucrative**- the average salary for software programmers in Australia is AUD$2003 per
  week (sourced on 26/02/22 from [here](https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/software-engineers?occupationCode=261313))
- It has a **low barrier to entry**- you _don't need_ a university
  degree (or even a highschool education) to enter the field due to the insane demand for high-quality developers.
- It's also **secure**, with the field being one of the most resilient in the face of the pandemic with work from home arrangements.

Asides from the lucrative employment benefits, learning to program can have a
myriad of other benefits to your everyday life. Some of the biggest benefits we've seen are as follows:

- Programming trains you to be a better problem solver. By learning
  to program you implicitly train your ability to take a big, intimidating
  problem and break it down into smaller problems that you can solve with ease.
- Programming forces you to learn to describe the steps involved in a task, or
  the problems you are having with your code, in ways that are completely
  unambiguous. By doing this you becoming better at communicating unambiguously
  in everyday life, making it easier for you to get help from others, or work effectively in teams.
- Programming makes you an expert in googling, and quickly identifying useful
  and unuseful sources. It also helps you learn to identify solutions that can be adapted from their original purpose to save you time and effort.

Finally, we believe there's just something really damn cool about having an idea, translating it into your own program, then giving it to a computer and watching it impact the world.

## Why did we choose python?

When looking for a first programming language, Python is high on almost every
list- for good reason! Python is often considered the easiest
programming language to learn, as it reads very closely to English. Python's
ability to facilitate the quick development of readable code for most real-world problems has allowed it to become the number one programming language in fields such as artificial intelligence, statistics, and general scripting. Python is also extremely popular in a wide range of other software fields, such as web development with Django or Flask; or in cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure) with cloud functions.

In addition to ease of use, Python is extremely powerful, and is the 4th most commonly used language in industry (according to the 2020 StackOverflow developer survey). This popularity not only makes it invaluable to add to your resume, but also means there is an abundance of resources when you get stuck. To break down why we still think Python is the best language to learn first, let's look at the languages that outrank it within that survey:

- **JavaScript**: a language whose initial purpose was to bring dynamic content to the web. Modern Javascript has come a long way from
  its original version (which was created in only 10 days!), and is now a powerful language that has cemented itself in the web-stack. Despite
  its shiny exterior, it has inherited a large number of quirks from its earlier versions that often make it difficult to learn for new programmers. Furthermore, being designed for use in web-browsers puts additional hurdles in the way of newcomers for running javascript locally.
- **HTML/CSS**: these are not technically considered programming languages, and serve their own niche purposes, being the structure and styling of web pages respectively. You can't extend your knowledge from these to other more powerful languages easily. Again, their popularity come from their necessary use in web development.
- **SQL**: this language is specifically for managing databases. Again, you can't easily extend your knowledge from SQL to other programming languages.

Even if you are solely interested in making websites, we would still recommend learning Python first, over JavaScript, HTML and CSS. One of the authors (we won't point out which (it was Harry)) attempted, and struggled somewhat, to learn the latter three before they had any other experience in programming. After they had become proficient in Python, with the insights it brought, they came back and found it trivially easy to learn the web stack, resulting in a somewhat successful web development company for a number of years.

Python is extremely flexible, offering four popular programming paradigms; imperative, functional, procedural, and object-oriented. This makes Python a good general-purpose language, and a great starting point from which to learn more languages.

The major arguments against Python are normally in regards to its speed. Python, as an dynamically-typed, interpreted language, is technically slower than compiled languages. However, the savings in development time often outrank any efficiency difference, particularly now that compute resources are so cheap.

The other popular argument against Python is that you must use the correct whitespace; missing a tab or space somewhere can completely change the meaning of your program.
While this is said to be annoying for beginners, when you work as a software engineer you should be following strict style guidelines that enforce specific uses of whitespace.
Python therefore encourages good styling habits for when this restriction is lifted in other languages.
