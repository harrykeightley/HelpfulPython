# Welcome!

Welcome to HelpfulPython; a free course designed to teach absolute beginners the
fundamentals of programming in Python. Read below to find out why you should take our course, or just [jump straight in!](/course)

## What will you learn in this course?
The focus of this course is on teaching important programming fundamentals and
good habits, rather than just providing an overview of syntax. We want you to be able to take the concepts you have learned in the course and quickly adapt to using a new language if need be. By the end of this course you should be able to solve or automate real-world tasks with programming, and you should have a solid baseline to extend your knowledge independently in order to solve increasingly complex  problems.  Having said that, the course is designed for people who have never programmed before, so the first few sections will introduce basic Python syntax.

The major topics taught in this course are as follows.
- Installing Python, using the read-evaluate-print-loop (REPL), and creating,
saving, and running Python code files.
- Basic syntax
- Control structures
- Functions
- Documentation
- Basic debugging strategies
- In-built and third-party libraries
- File IO
- Classes
- Inheritance
- Introductory design patterns (optional)
- Introductory complexity analysis (optional)
- List comprehensions and generators (optional)
- Lambda functions (optional)

You may choose to skip any of the topics if you have prior knowledge, or if they
are labelled as optional.

## Why us?
The authors of this course have a combined decade worth of experience in teaching university students how to program for the first time.
Through our teaching experience, we have gained some fairly unique insight into the areas which cause the most trouble for students, and we both wanted the chance to teach our favourite topics in the way we wish we were taught.

Both authors currently work in software (across industry, start ups, and academia), so we interact with code written by others on a daily basis. Due to this, we're invested in creating a new generation of programmers who create high-quality code that can be understood and extended easily by other programmers.

To learn more about the authors of this course, see the [About Us](/about) page.

## Why should you learn to code?
The most obvious reason to learn to code is because you want to get a job in
software. The average salary for software programmers in Australia is AUD$2003 a
week (sourced on 26/02/22 from [here](https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations/software-engineers?occupationCode=261313)) and you don't need a university
degree (or even a year 12 level education) to enter the field. Maybe you're preparing for university and want to get a head start, or you want to skip university entirely but still be qualified to enter industry. Maybe the pandemic
has inspired a career switch into a field where you can work from home
indefinitely with a high degree of job security, or maybe you just want to give
your resume a boost, even if you don't want to work in software. Regardless of
your employment situation, learning to code is always a valuable skill to invest
in.

Asides from the lucrative employment benefits, learning to program can have a
myriad of other benefits to your everyday life. Some of the biggest benefits we've seen are as follows:
- Programming trains you to be a better problem solver. By learning
to program you implicitly train your ability to take a big, intimidating
problem and break it down into smaller problems you know you can solve.
- Programming forces you to learn to describe the steps involved in a task, or
the problems you are having with your code, in ways that are completely
unambiguous. By doing this you becoming better at communicating unambiguously
in everyday life, making it easier for you to get help from others, or work effectively in teams.
- Programming makes you an expert in googling, and quickly identifying useful
and unuseful sources. It also helps you learn to identify solutions that can be adapted from their original purpose to save you time and effort.

## Why did we choose python?
When looking for a first programming language, Python is high on almost every
list, and there's good reason for this. Python is often considered the easiest
programming language to learn, as it reads very closely to English. Python's
ability to facilitate the quick development of readable code for most real-world probelms has allowed to to become the number one programming language in fields such as artificial intelligence, statistics, and scripting. Python is also extremely popular in a wide range of other software fields, such as web development.

Despite Python's ease of use, it is extremely powerful, and is the 4th most commonly used language in industry (according to the 2020 StackOverflow developer survey). This popularity not only makes it invaluable to add to your resume, but also means there is an abundance of resources when you get stuck. To break down why we still think Python is the best language to learn first, lets look at the languages that outrank it:
- JavaScript: a language that most software engineers generally despise, its popularity comes from its often necessary use in web development. JavaScript was originally created in only 10 days, and this shows through the large number of quirks that make it difficult to use.
- HTML/CSS: these are not technically considered programming languages, and serve their own niche purposes. You can't extend your knowledge from these to other more powerful languages easily. Again, their popularity come from their necessary use in web development.
- SQL: this language is specifically for managing databases. Again, you can't easily extend your knowledge from SQL to other programming languages.

Python is extremely flexible, offering four popular programming paradigms; imperative, functional, procedural, and object-oriented. This makes Python a good general-purpose language, and a great starting point to learn more languages.

The major arguments against Python are normally in regards to its speed. Python, as an dynamically-typed interpreted language, is technically slower than compiled languages. However, the savings in development time often outrank efficiency difference, particularly now that compute resources are so cheap.

The other popular argument against Python is that you must use the correct whitespace; missing a tab or space somewhere can completely change the meaning of your program. While this can be annoying for beginners, when you work as a software engineer you should be following strict style guidelines that enforce specific uses of whitespace anyway. Python gets you into a good habit for when this restriction is later lifted in other languages.
