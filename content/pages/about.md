# 👋🏻 About us 👋🏻

## Ashleigh

Ashleigh Richardson is a PhD candidate at the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at the University of Queensland (UQ), having received her Bachelor of Software Engineering with first class honours from UQ in 2018. Her research interests include sequence transduction, natural language processing, machine learning for creativity, and machine learning for low-resource applications. Her research work focuses on creating better low-resource neural machine translation systems for use in real-world applications.

Ashleigh has over six years of experience teaching topics ranging from introductory programming, computer systems principles and programming, and machine learning.

## Harry

Harry Keightley has a bachelor's in computer science, which Ashleigh would claim isn't as cool as software engineering, but he gets to call himself a scientist, which must be worth _something_. He has spent 4 wonderful years, teaching university students how to program for the first time, and hopes that this project will allow him to pass the insights he's learnt over to the next generation of programmers.

Harry currently works as a Senior Research Assistant at the University of Queensland, where he is building machine-learning tools to help linguists preserve endangered languages. He also works as a freelance web developer for his own company, and is building a social media startup.
