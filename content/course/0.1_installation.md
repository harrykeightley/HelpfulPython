# Installation

To install python, head to [the python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and click the large yellow download button. This should give you the appropriate installer for your operating system.

At the time of writing, python is at version **3.10**, and this is the version we will be using for the rest of the course.

Once the download has finished, open up the installer from wherever you saved it.
At this point, the instructions will change slightly based on the operating system you're using.

## Installing on Mac

After opening the installer on mac you should see the following:

Click continue/agree until you reach the _Installation Type_ stage.

Here you want to select the _Customise_ option and make sure your settings match the following picture before installing.

Hit install. At the end of the installation process, I'd recommend that you click the button to install the SSL certificates, which can cause an annoying headache later on.

## Installing on Windows

After opening the installer on windows you should see the following (with a slightly different installation path):

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure you check the _Add Python 3.10 to PATH_ box before proceeding.

The default settings are appropriate for most users, but if you want to install to a different location on your computer, you can choose the _Customize Installation_ option.
Otherwise, let's begin the default installation process by clicking _Install Now_.

After the installation succeeds, you can close out of the installer.

_Note_: if you encounter errors or want to know more at any step, a quick google search should answer everything you need.

## Next steps

Congratulations üëè, you should now have python installed for your OS, and can proceed to writing your first program in the next section!
