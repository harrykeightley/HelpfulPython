# Your first program
In this section, we will learn:
- How to create a new Python file
- How to write a simple program in a Python file
- How to save and run a Python file
- How to communicate between the shell and a code from a Python file.

## Opening a new file
Once you've opened IDLE to the shell, you can create a new Python file by going
File -> New File.

## Running your program
Your program must be saved before you can run it. Save your file by going File -> Save, and then run it by pressing Run -> Run Module.
You can also do this by just going Run -> Run Module, and saving the file at the prompt.

Once you've run your file you'll be taken back to the shell.
