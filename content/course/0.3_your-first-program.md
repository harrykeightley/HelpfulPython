# Your first program

In this section, we will learn:

- How to create a new Python file
- How to write a simple Python program
- How to save and run a Python file
- How to communicate between the shell and code executed from a Python file.

## Opening a new file

Once you've opened IDLE and have been placed on the shell (or REPL), you can create a new Python file by going to File -> New File. Save your file by going File -> Save, and name your file `hello.py`. It should look something like this when you're done.

## Running your program

Once you've saved your file, you can run it by clicking Run -> Run Module, or by pressing F5. If you haven't saved your file, you will be prompted to do so here. Once you've run your file you'll be taken back to the shell, which will look like:

You'll notice that there's some text saying 'RESTART: ', followed by the path to your file. This just lets us know that we've restarted the shell, after we've run the python file at that path. However, our program has no interesting behaviour to be printed out to the shell yet, since we didn't write any code within it. Let's fix that by going back to the file and adding something.

## Hello, World! part 2: Adding code to your file

To start with, we'll just add in the code to print out Hello, World!, which we saw in the last section. Go to `hello.py` and add:

```
print('Hello, World!')
```

Save the file and run it again. You should now see that the text prints to the shell!

## Making the program interactive

Instead of printing out 'Hello, World!', let's make our program a little more interactive, and personalise the greeting to our user. Go back to your `hello.py` file and change the code to:

```
name = input('Enter your name: ')
print('Hello, ' + name + '!')
```

There's a lot going on in this code snippet that you're not expected to know just yet. For now just type it in, and we'll explain how everything works in Chapter 1 of this course.

Now save and run your program, and you'll see you're prompted with the text `'Enter your name: '` in the shell. Type in your name at this prompt, and your program will say hello to you!

Congratulations on writing your first interactive program!
