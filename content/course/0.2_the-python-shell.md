# The Python Shell (REPL)

In this section, we will learn:

- How to open the IDLE shell
- How the IDLE shell works
- How to write simple code in the shell, and interpret the output
<!-- To install python, head to [the python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and click the large yellow download button. This should give you the appropriate installer for your operating system.

At the time of writing, python is at version **3.10**, and this is the version we will be using for the rest of the course.

Once the download has finished, open up the installer from wherever you saved it. -->

## Opening IDLE

Once you've installed Python, IDLE should be installed on your system by default.
You can open IDLE on Mac by pressing command+spacebar and typing in IDLE. If you're
familiar with another editor or IDE, feel free to use that in place of IDLE throughout
the course.

<!-- No idea for windows?? -->

## Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop

When you open IDLE, you'll be taken to a window showing the read-evaluate-print-loop, or REPL.
This is also sometimes called the 'shell'.

The REPL is named as such because each time you enter a command at the '>>>' prompt, it will:

- **R**ead the command
- **E**valuate it
- **P**rint the result,
- and then repeat (or **L**oop).

The REPL is useful for executing quick, one-liner commands that you don't need to rerun, or
for quickly testing code you've written elsewhere. However, you should be aware that the code you write on the REPL
can't be saved or rerun easily. This means that typically, you'll write all your projects in a
separate Python file, which we'll describe in the next section.

## Hello, World! part 1: Running commands in the REPL

Open IDLE and type the following code at the prompt (don't copy the >>>, this appears to denote that the line will be evaluated on the REPL):

```
>>> print('Hello, World!')
```

When you press enter, you'll notice that the REPL replies to your command with the text `Hello, World!`:

```
>>> print('Hello, World!')
Hello, World!
```

This is because the `print` command _prints_ (surprisingly) the text inside the parentheses to the shell.
Another thing to note for the future is that in the output, the single quotes that previously surrounded `Hello World!` have been stripped. We will explain why this happens in a future section when we start to talk about _strings_.

If you want to run this line again, you'll need to either retype it, copy and paste it to the prompt again, or use a shortcut to copy and paste it. In IDLE, this shortcut is to click on the line you want to copy and press Enter.

In the next section, we'll see how to make a Python file, in which you can save code and rerun it over and over without having to copy it every time.
