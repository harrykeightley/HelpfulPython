# The Python Shell (REPL)
In this section, we will learn:
- How to open the IDLE shell
- How the IDLE shell works
- How to write simple code in the shell, and interpret the output
<!-- To install python, head to [the python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and click the large yellow download button. This should give you the appropriate installer for your operating system.

At the time of writing, python is at version **3.10**, and this is the version we will be using for the rest of the course.

Once the download has finished, open up the installer from wherever you saved it. -->

## Opening IDLE
Once you've installed Python, IDLE should be installed on your system by default.
You can open IDLE on Mac by pressing command+spacebar and typing in IDLE. If you're
familiar with another editor or IDE, feel free to use that in place of IDLE throughout
the course.
<!-- No idea for windows?? -->

## Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop
When you open IDLE, you'll be taken to a window showing the read-evaluate-print-loop, or REPL.
This is also sometimes called the 'shell'.

The REPL is named as such because each time you enter a command at the '>>>' prompt, it will
read the command, evaluate it, print the result, and then reprompt (loop). The REPL
is useful for executing quick, one-liner commands that you don't need to rerun, and
for quickly testing code you've written elsewhere. However, the code you write here
can't be saved or rerun easily, so you'll typically write all your projects in a
Python file, which we'll touch on later.
